ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project is the game I developed. It is a chance based game that is a Russian roulette tournament. The play has to make it through a 32
person 5 round tournament where they can increase their chances of survival along the way. The game features multiple menus, varying game statistics,
custom costumes and more.
